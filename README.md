# Hackmud scripts

This is a repository of all my scripts that I feel like publishing.  
All scripts are written in such a way that minifying them with muddler won't break them. (They may break muddler though.)

##### Note
###### Please note that these scripts were never meant to be readable so don't expect nice formatting for readability. Or comment explaining the functionality.
