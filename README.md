# Hackmud scripts

This is a repository of all my scripts that I feel like publishing.  
All scripts are written in such a way that minifying them with muddler won't break them. (You'd be surprised.)

##### Note
###### Please note that these scripts were never meant to be readable so don't expect nice formatting for readability.
